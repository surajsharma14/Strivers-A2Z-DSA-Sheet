 is learning about functions and calling a function with arguments. He learns that passing can take one of two forms: pass by value or pass by reference.

Geek wishes to add 1 and 2, respectively, to the parameter passed by value and reference. Help Geek in fulfilling his goal.

Example 1:

Input:
a = 1
b = 2
Output:
2 4
Explanation: 1 was passed by value whereas 2 passed by reference.
Example 2:

Input:
a = 10
b = 20
Output: 11 22
Explanation: 10 was passed by value whereas 20 passed by reference.
